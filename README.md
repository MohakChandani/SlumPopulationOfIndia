This project was undertaken by me as an academic project work in the field of 'Geographic Information Technologies'. This project is a webmap showing the various aspects of the Slum Population in India mapped on a dynamic map.

# Abstract
In India due to rapid industrialization, lack of employment  opportunities in rural areas , low wages, ineffective  land  reforms  etc  about  one  third  of  the  population    live  in  slums  and  the  like  conditions  in  urban areas. Likewise  about  27  percentage  of  population  occupy  only  5  percentage  of  the  urban  land  area.  These unimproved  slums  are  characterized  by  overcrowding  dilapidated  structures,  Unhygienic  living  conditions, grossly inadequate basic amenities, unplanned layouts and poor accessibility. Hence slum dwellers need to be enlightened on their potential contributions for ensuring sustainable development in the urban areas. 

Urban  India  is  undergoing  a  process  of  great  transformation  in  the  midst  of  economic  reform, liberalization  and  globalization.  Many  cities  and  towns  are  fast  emerging  as  centre  of  growth.  It  is estimated that by 2030 more than 50 per cent of the country's population will live in cities and towns. This is likely to pose serious problems to urban planners, policy-makers and managers of urban affairs in terms  of increased requirement of funds for infrastructure development and management. Despite' significant  emphasis  laid  on  improvement  of  infrastructure  development  in  the  successive  five  year plans,  deficiencies  in  urban  infrastructure  continue  with  poor  service  delivery.  

To address the above issues, we decided to undertake this project. The various layers and all the processing and creation of the maps was done on 'QGIS' which is a open-source cross-platform desktop geographic information system application that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data. Then a webmap was created using the layers exported from Qgis. 'LeafletJS' was used to build this interactive webmap along with some Html, Css and Javascript. As the data used for generating these mappings was limited, the webmap is built on a static website.

Any suggestions on improving this webmap would be highly appreciated!!
